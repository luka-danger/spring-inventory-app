Static/Script:
<ul>
<li>Created a script directory to store newly created script.js JavaScript file</li>
<li>Created custom JavaScript Functions:</li>
<ul>
<li>updateTableOverflow(): This function prevents the tables from overflowing, or "spilling", 
out of the designated container (div) by adding a table overflow: scroll property to both
the product and the parts inventory tables on the main screen when the tables have a height 
greater than 176px (roughly 7 rows + a table head). These changes affect the mainscreen.html 
file and affect the tables on lines 59-80 and lines 99-125. </li>
<li>displayAlert(): This function displays an alert when the two dummy links "Forgot Password" 
and "Sign Up" are clicked on the login page. This alert informs the user that the links do not 
work, as this is not a real website. These changes affect the login.html file and affect the 
"Forgot Password" link on Line 37 and the "Sign Up" link on Line 44.</li>
</ul>
<li>noInventory(): This function changes the font color of the name and inventory number
of any item on the product table where the inventory number is equal to zero. The font color
is changed to red to indicate that the item is out of stock. This function can be found on
Lines 14 - 24.</li>
